Captain's log, stardate May 4th, 2018. This is the final entry in the chronicles of Mulenerva development. 
It has been some time since my last entry; I took a bit of a reprieve after our final demonstrations. 
The crew has finalized everything that could be finalized. 
It has been a long, arduous journey, but somehow, we made out on the other side in one piece, if only barely. 
We almost lost Shane to the void at one time; we dragged him back from the brink by the tips of his ears.

Throughout the course of our journey, many tears fell, blood was shed, friendships were created and destroyed, 
entire civilizations rose and fell, but in the end, Mulenerva was completed. 
For better or for worse. The crew is proud of our achievements. 
And rightfully so; the final results of our endeavors were fruitful - we set our goals and met them. 

As the U.S.S. Mulenerva makes its final approach to its port of origin, the crew is making their final preparations for departure. 
Everyone is writing their final journal entries, logging their changes, creating their after action reports, and preparing for home. 
The future is bright for the crew of the U.S.S. Mulenerva; the sky is not the limit, 
for their is no limit for a crew of this level of magnificence. 

Signing off for the last time, this is Captain Jonathon A. Phelan.
May the 4th be with you.
